## Description
The Streamlit Data Analysis Application is designed to make data analysis accessible and straightforward. Users can upload CSV files, visualize the data using PCA and t-SNE, and apply machine learning algorithms for classification and clustering. The application was tested with two well-known datasets, `IRIS` and `wine_quality`.

## Features
- **File Upload:** Upload CSV files for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize data using PCA and t-SNE.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generate descriptive statistics and correlation heatmaps.
- **Classification Algorithms:** Apply KNeighborsClassifier and RandomForestClassifier to classify data.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Use KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering for data clustering.
- **Comparison of Algorithms:** Evaluate and compare the performance of different algorithms.
